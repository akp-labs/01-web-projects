# Reflex Timer

Think your reflexes are fast? Prove it.
Reflex Timer is a minimal, game-like reflex testing tool built with a clean green-on-black UI. It goes beyond a basic timer by adding unpredictability, visual pressure, and simple navigation—so your reaction time actually gets tested, not babysat.
Two navigation buttons, zero distractions, straight to the point.

## Main Features
    - Reaction time measured precisely in milliseconds
    - Downloadable score history exported as an HTML file
    - Randomly colored boxes appear on the screen to increase difficulty and prevent pattern learning
    - Box change location if not clicked for one second randomly
