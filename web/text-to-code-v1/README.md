# Text to Code v1

Privacy matters.

Messages can be read by anyone with access to a device or group.  
But what if only the people *you choose* could understand your message?

**Text to Code** transforms plain text into emoji- or symbol-based code that can only be decoded using this program.  
Even if others have the app, your message stays private by using a **custom code map** shared only with trusted recipients.

### Main Features
- Instant text ↔ code conversion  
- Custom code map support  
- Terminal-style UI for a privacy-focused feel
