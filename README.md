# 02-web-projects

A compact suite of browser-based utilities and mini-apps — from everyday calculators to classic web games — all written in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A playground of logic, UI, and creativity.

Each project is intentionally lightweight, focusing on fundamentals. The emphasis is on understanding how things work in the browser: event handling, rendering, user interaction, and state management — without abstractions getting in the way.

This repository serves both as a learning archive and a rapid-experiment space, where small ideas can be implemented quickly without the overhead of creating separate repositories for every mini project.

## Goals

- Strengthen core web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Practice DOM manipulation and browser event handling
- Build interactive tools and small games without frameworks
- Explore UI logic, timing, and user input handling
- Maintain clean, readable, and standalone web projects
